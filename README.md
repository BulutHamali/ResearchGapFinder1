# ResearchGapFinder

**AI-powered system for discovering scientific research gaps and generating testable hypotheses**

ResearchGapFinder is an open-source, end-to-end scientific discovery tool that scans biomedical literature (PubMed, EuropePMC), detects knowledge gaps, and proposes mechanistic, experiment-ready hypotheses — all through a single pipeline with a professional web UI.

---

## Why This Tool

Scientific literature is growing faster than any human can read. Existing tools address pieces of this problem — Elicit and Iris.ai focus on literature mapping and Q&A, while LBD frameworks like SKiM-GPT focus on hypothesis scoring. ResearchGapFinder is different:

- **End-to-end pipeline**: From raw query to validated gaps, scored hypotheses, and specific experimental designs — not just associations or literature summaries.
- **Mechanistic focus**: Gaps and hypotheses target biological mechanisms, not surface-level topic overlaps.
- **Open-source and extensible**: Modular architecture with a model-agnostic LLM interface. No vendor lock-in.
- **Structured and scored outputs**: Every gap and hypothesis includes numeric scores for novelty, support, feasibility, and impact.
- **Professional UI**: Dark-theme Streamlit interface with radar charts, score bars, and cluster visualizations.

## Who It's For

- Bioinformatics and computational biology researchers
- Biomedical scientists preparing grant proposals
- Translational medicine teams exploring new therapeutic angles
- Anyone doing early-stage discovery research or literature review

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Backend | Python 3.11, FastAPI, Uvicorn |
| Frontend | Streamlit, Plotly |
| Retrieval | PubMed E-utilities API, EuropePMC REST API |
| Concept extraction | PubTator3 API |
| Embeddings | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (default) · `FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023` (max_quality) |
| Vector database | FAISS (default) · Pinecone (optional) |
| Clustering | HDBSCAN, scikit-learn k-means |
| LLM | Groq API — `llama-3.1-8b-instant` / `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| Caching | diskcache (disk-based, SHA-256 keyed) |

## Quality Presets

| Preset | LLM (Groq model ID) | Embeddings | Max Papers | RAM | Best For |
|--------|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----|---------|
| `cheap_fast` | `llama-3.1-8b-instant` | MiniLM | 500 | ~150 MB | Quick demos, free tier |

---

## Gap Detection: How It Works

Gaps are not simply "topics with few papers." The system uses a structured taxonomy:

| Gap Type | Definition | Detection Method |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Explicit gap** | Authors state "X remains unknown" | NLP phrase extraction from abstracts |
| **Implicit gap** | Expected concept co-occurrence is missing | Association measures across clusters |
| **Missing link** | A→B and B→C exist, but A→C is unexplored | ABC chain analysis on concept graphs |
| **Contradictory gap** | Studies disagree on a mechanism | Stance detection on shared concepts |

Each detected gap includes:
- **Type** (from taxonomy above)
- **Evidence snippets** with PMIDs
- **Competing explanations**
- **Reason for underexploration** (methodological, ethical, or neglect)
- **Uncertainty rating** (low / medium / high)

---

## Hypothesis Scoring

Every generated hypothesis receives four numeric scores (0.0 – 1.0):

| Score | What It Measures |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Novelty** | How little direct support currently exists |
| **Support** | Strength of indirect / mechanistic evidence |
| **Feasibility** | Testability with standard lab methods |
| **Impact** | Clinical importance or pathway centrality |

A composite score (average of all four) is shown in the UI alongside a radar chart.

## Example Workflow

**Query:** `TP53 ferroptosis breast cancer`

**Retrieved:** ~100–2,000 papers (with MeSH-expanded synonyms)

**Clusters:**
- Cluster 0 — Tumor suppressor signaling (silhouette: 0.72)
- Cluster 1 — Ferroptosis regulation (silhouette: 0.68)
- Cluster 2 — Breast cancer resistance (silhouette: 0.71)

**Detected gap:**
> Few studies directly examine how TP53 mutation status shapes ferroptosis sensitivity in therapy-resistant breast cancer subtypes.
>
> *Type: Implicit gap · Uncertainty: High · Reason: Methodological — requires isogenic cell line panels*

**Generated hypothesis:**
> Loss or mutation of TP53 may alter ferroptosis sensitivity by rewiring oxidative stress response pathways (particularly GPX4 and SLC7A11) in therapy-resistant breast cancer cells.
>
> Novelty: 0.78 · Support: 0.65 · Feasibility: 0.82 · Impact: 0.85

**Suggested experiments:**

| Experiment | Modality | Assays | Complexity |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----------|
| Compare WT vs mutant TP53 isogenic lines | Genetic perturbation | Cell viability (RSL3/erastin), BODIPY lipid ROS | Medium |
| Measure GPX4/SLC7A11 expression | Molecular profiling | Western blot, qPCR | Low |
| Transcriptomic analysis under ferroptosis induction | Omics profiling | RNA-seq | High |

## Deployment (Render)

The repo includes a `render.yaml` blueprint that deploys two services automatically:

1. **Fork / clone the repo** to your GitHub
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) → **New → Blueprint** → connect repo
3. Set the secret environment variables when prompted:
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - `PUBMED_EMAIL`
   - `PINECONE_API_KEY` *(optional — leave blank to use FAISS)*
4. Click **Apply** — both services build and deploy automatically

**Live URLs after deploy:**
- Frontend: `https://researchgapfinder-frontend.onrender.com`
- Backend: `https://researchgapfinder-backend.onrender.com`

> **Note:** Free tier services sleep after 15 min of inactivity. First request after sleep takes ~30–60s.

## Token Optimization

LLMs cannot process thousands of papers directly. The system separates concerns:

1. Cluster papers → reduces thousands of papers to N clusters
2. Summarize each cluster with top TF-IDF terms and paper count
3. Send only cluster summaries + statistical gap signals to the LLM

**Example:** 500 papers → 12 clusters → 12 summaries → LLM reasoning

This keeps costs low while preserving the breadth of the literature scan.

---

## Evaluation Strategy

### Intrinsic System Evaluation
- **Retrieval**: Precision/recall against curated benchmark queries
- **Clustering**: Silhouette scores, Davies-Bouldin index, topic coherence
- **Gap detection**: Agreement with human annotators on labeled corpora

### Retrospective Hypothesis Validation
*Can the system, run on a 2015 corpus, predict a link confirmed in 2016–2025 literature?*

- Hide all papers after a cutoff year
- Generate hypotheses from the truncated corpus
- Check if any were confirmed by subsequent publications

---

---

## Transparency and Safety

Every gap and hypothesis includes:
- **Supporting paper snippets** with cited sentences and PMIDs
- **Reasoning summary** generated strictly from evidence snippets
- **Confidence calibration** via numeric scores

**Safety guardrails:**
- No direct therapeutic recommendations to patients
- Explicit disclaimers on associative vs. causal findings
- Hard filters preventing over-interpretation of observational results
